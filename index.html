    <p class="bold">Here is a collection of things to refer back to when developing in html and css.</p>
    <div>
      <span class='tipTitle'>Colours</span>
      <p> Colours can be represented in lots of ways in css. Some provide more capabilities than others.</p>
      <div>
          <p><span class='bold'>Name</span> - There are a set of colours that can be referenced with a plain english name. Some examples include <span  class='codeExample'> blue, red, blueviolet</span></p>
          <p><span class='bold'>HexCode</span> - Colours can also be represented by a hexadecimal code. These should be written with a hashtag before like these examples. <span  class='codeExample'> #CB3EBD, #71CE90, #9B2020</span></p>
          <p><span class='bold'>RGBA</span> - a great method for  representing colours in css that also allows you to  control transparency is by using  rgba. The 3 values describe the quantity of red, green and blue. Each of the values have a max of 255 except for the last value (alpha). Alpha is entered as a percentage and controlls the opacity of the text. One example of a colour represented with rgba is  <span  class='codeExample'> rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.6)</span></p>
